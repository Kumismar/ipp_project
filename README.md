# IPP project
IPPCode23 parser and interpret for IPP course at FIT BUT.

Final Evalutation: 11.8/20
Parser: 7.8/8
Interpret: 4/12

The points for interpret seem cruel but all the 800ish lines of code were written in one 16-hour session of programming (in the day of deadline). 3 points were for documentation and OO design which I didn't have at all, so it's solid 4/9 for functionality. All the instructions are functional (with small or no errors), flow-control instructions were not implemented at all.

If you're brave enough to inspect the interpret source code, good luck with not losing your sanity (it's the ugliest code I've ever written - it was a speedrun).

## For FIT students that came for an inspiration
Feel free to get inspired by the source files as much as you like but rememeber, anything too much is bad.
